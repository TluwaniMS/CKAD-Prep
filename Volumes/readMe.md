# Volumes.

In Kubernetes, a volume is a directory accessible to containers in a pod. It is an abstraction that allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of the container.

Volumes enable data to be shared between containers in a pod or stored persistently across pod restarts or rescheduling. They play a crucial role in maintaining stateful applications by ensuring that data persists and remains accessible to pods or containers within a Kubernetes cluster.
